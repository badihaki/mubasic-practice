# mubasic-practice

This is a practice app where I reverse-engineer Mubasic. I will need the following components:
  - A loading page
    - Different-colored divs to show loading
    - Loading divs scroll-animate into view
    - Wait a few seconds and new view scrolls into place
  - A musical-notes page
    - Elements need to scroll into view
    - Different divs for different notes
      - Notes need to play music onClick()
      - Notes also need to play the same track when you press their corresponding button
